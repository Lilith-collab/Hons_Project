```{r}

Gracilaria_data <- read_excel("C:/Users/Win10/Desktop/UCT/Honours Project Gracilaria/Data/Statistical_Analyses_R/RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.xlsx")

GracilariaID_data <- Gracilaria_data  %>%
  mutate(ID = paste0(substr(Species,1,1), substr(word(Species,2),1,1), "_W", Week,"_T", Tank_No,"_", substr(Measurement_Type,1,1),sprintf("%02d", Measurement_No),"_",   format(Date, "%Y%m%d")))%>%
  select(ID, everything()) 

sum(duplicated(GracilariaID_data$ID))


```

 Processing the data Average STD of length and weight . 
 Then calc for growth rate per day
```{r}

Ave <- GracilariaID_data %>%
  group_by(Week,Treatment ,Measurement_Type) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_value = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

 length <-GracilariaID_data %>%
  group_by(Week,Treatment ) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_value = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )






GracilariaRGR_data <- GracilariaID_data  %>%
  mutate(GracilariaRGR_data, RGR_Length =(Formula for growth rate))


 ggplot(length, aes(x = , y = length$mean_value )) +
   geom_boxplot() +
   facet_wrap(~ Week) +
   theme_minimal()









```

using anova and t test we need to module the data by relative significances 
growth rate - length over time point or even with weight. to also compared the 
different treatments to one other.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

4+4

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
